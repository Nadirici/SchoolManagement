# School Management Application

A comprehensive system for managing students, teachers, courses, enrollments, and grades, developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework with Hibernate for ORM and MySQL as the database.

## Features

- CRUD operations for **Students**, **Teachers**, **Courses**, **Enrollments**, and **Grades**.
- Unique **UUID** identifiers for each entity.
- Enroll and disenroll students in courses.
- Manage grades for students in each enrolled course.
- RESTful API design with standardized JSON responses.
- Error handling and validation. **(TODO)**

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA for managing entities and repositories.
- **Database**: MySQL database with tables for each entity.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects are used for encapsulating request/response data.
- **Mapping**: ModelMapper for mapping between entities and DTOs.

## Technologies

- **Java** (JDK 23.0.1 or higher)
- **Spring Boot** (3.3.5+)
- **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate**
- **MySQL** Database
- **ModelMapper** for entity-DTO mapping
- **Lombok** (optional for getters, setters, and constructors)
- **Maven** for dependency management

### Database Schema

| Table         | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ``students``  | Manages student data                         |
| `teachers`    | Manages teacher data                         |
| `courses`     | Manages course details                       |
| `enrollments` | Tracks student-course links                  |
| `grades`      | Records grades per enrollment and assignment |
| `assignments`  | Records assignments by course                |

## üóÉÔ∏è Sample Data for Testing

For convenience, a `init.sql` file is included in the project. This file contains pre-configured test data that can be used to populate the database quickly. By loading this data, you can experiment with and test the various API endpoints without needing to manually insert records.

- **Usage:** Import the sample-data.sql file into your database. This will create test records for `Student`, `Course` and `Enrollment` entities.
- **Objective:** Quickly set up a testing environment to validate API requests and application behavior.
This file is especially helpful for trying out the enrollment and student-course relationship queries, as well as testing new API functionalities as they are added.
